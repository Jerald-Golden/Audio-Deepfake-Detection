# Description
Voice Deepfake Detection is a web application that utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze audio files and determine if they are real or generated by deepfake algorithms. It features user registration, audio file upload, audio feature extraction, comparison with a pre-defined dataset, and classification of audio as real or deepfake. 


# Voice Deepfake Detection

Voice Deepfake Detection is a web application that uses machine learning techniques to analyze audio files and determine if they are real or generated by deepfake algorithms.

# Features

- User registration and login system.
- Audio file upload for analysis.
- Audio feature extraction using MFCC, mel spectrogram, chroma features, zero crossing rate, spectral centroid, and spectral flatness.
- Comparison of extracted features with a pre-defined dataset.
- Classification of audio as either real or deepfake.
- Visual representation of the analysis results.

# Usage
1.Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
2.Upload an audio file for analysis.
3.Wait for the analysis to complete.
4.View the result, indicating whether the uploaded audio is classified as real or a deepfake.
5.Repeat the process for additional audio files.
